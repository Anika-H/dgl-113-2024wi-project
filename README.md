## Proposal
I have included the website's files (HTML, CSS, and images) in the doc's folder. There are three JavaScript features I will be adding to the Lady Fit website. I have included the three features below.

Back-to-top: I would like to implement smooth scrolling to a back-to-top button to enhance the user experience when navigating the page. If a user reaches the bottom of the page, instead of having to scroll back, they can easily click on the back-to-top button and be taken back to the top of the page. I will need to add an HTML "back-to-top" button, CSS styling for the button, and Javascript to accomplish the smooth scrolling back to the top of the page.

Drop-down menu in navigation: I plan on creating a drop-down menu to improve the navigation and organization of content on my website. For the services section of the navigation, I would like to add the different services as a drop-down menu when hovering over the services section of the navigation. I will need to add a little bit of HTML and CSS. I will also need to include JavaScript.

Carousel: I would also like to include a carousel to showcase the cards on the homepage for the different services in an interactive and visually appealing way. Carousels often have content that captures users' attention. This will help engage users more effectively than static content. They also allow for the display of multiple pieces of content within a confined space. This is particularly useful when viewing a site on a small screen like a phone or tablet. I will use the existing HTML and CSS code for the cards to accomplish the carousel, but I will need to add JavaScript to get the cards to function like a carousel.
